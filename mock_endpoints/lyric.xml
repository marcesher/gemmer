    <Lyric>Ice Ice Baby
        Ice Ice Baby
        All right stop
        Collaborate and listen
        Ice is back with my brand new invention
        Something grabs a hold of me tightly
        Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
        Will it ever stop?
        Yo--I don't know
        Turn off the lights and I'll glow
        To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
        Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.

        Dance
        Bum rush the speaker that booms
        I'm killin your brain like a poisonous mushroom
        Deadly, when I play a dope melody
        Anything less than the best is a felony
        Love it or leave it
        You better gain way
        You better hit bull's eye
        The kid dont play
        If there was a problem
        Yo, I'll solve it
        Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

        Ice Ice Baby Vanilla (4X)

        Now that the party is jumping
        With the bass kicked in, and the Vegas are pumpin'
        Quick to the point, to the point no faking
        I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
        Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
        I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
        And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
        I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
        Rollin in my 5.0
        With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
        The girlies on standby
        Waving just to say HI
        Did you stop?
        No--I just drove by
        Kept on pursuing to the next stop
        I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
        That block was dead

        Yo--so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave.
        Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
        Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
        Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
        Shay with a guage and Vanilla with a nine
        Ready for the chumps on the wall
        The Chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight ball
        Gunshots ranged out like a bell
        I grabbed my nine--
        All I heard were shells
        Fallin on the concrete real fast
        Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
        Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
        I'm tryin to get away before the jackers jack
        Police on the scene
        You know what I mean
        They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
        If there was a problem
        Yo, I'll solve it
        Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

        Ice Ice Baby Vanilla (4X)

        Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
        Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
        My town, that created all the bass sound
        Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
        'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
        Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
        Conducted and formed
        This is a hell of a concept
        We make it hype and you want to step with this
        Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
        Cut like a razor blade so fast
        Other DJ's say, "Damn"
        If my rhyme was a drug
        I'd sell it by the gram
        Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
        Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
        If there was a problem
        Yo--I'll solve it!
        Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it.

        Ice Ice Baby Vanilla (4X)

        Yo man--let's get out of here!
        Word to your mother!

        Ice Ice baby Too Cold
